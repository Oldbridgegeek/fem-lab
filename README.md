# Finite Element Method implementation in octave

The target is to solve simple pde's with the unit square domain easily in octave.
Goal is to get a stable solver and sufficient error and convergence analysis. For solving the linear system 
we want to refer to a linear algebra library and try different solver e.g. GMRES or other Krylov subspace methods.
At the end we want to model our results and document them.
